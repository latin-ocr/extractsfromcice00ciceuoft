„ 90 NOTES. u—

26. Dividenti, ‘proposing to distribute.‘

31. Viritim, ‘to individuals.’ Till so distributed by special enactment,
the land remained state property, ‘ ager publicus?

Laudatio, ‘his funeral oration.'

33. In luce, ‘in public.'

34. Intus domique, ‘in his private and domestic life!

36. Augurii, here an adj. agreeing with ‘iuris.’ ‘ Ius augurium ' means
the established system of augury ’ So ‘ius pontificium.’

Ut in homine Romano, ‘ for a Roman.' The Romans acknowledged
their great inferiority to the Greeks in literature.

37. Domestica must here mean not civil wars, for at the time Cato is
supposed to say this there had been none, but ‘the wars of his own country‚’
and ‘ externa,’ ‘ those of foreign nations.’

11. 1. App. Claudii. This was the Appius Claudius whose censorship‚
31 2 B.c.‚ was famous for his great public works, the ‘ Via Appia‚' the ‘ great
south road' of Rome, and the ‘Aqua Appia‚’ an aqueduct‚ which brought
water to Rome a distance of eight miles; and also for his admission of freed-
men as citizens by enrolling them in tribes.

6. Viai, an old form of the gen. It is dependent on ‘quo‚' like ‘ubi
terrarum,’ ‘ eo audaciae.’

7. Et tamen—oratio. The force of ‘ tamen’ here is, ‘ though there is
no need to refer to Ennius, for Appius’ own speech is still extant! Arnold,
Hist. vol. 2, ch. 27, compares with this speech of Appius the famous protest
of Lord Chatham against yielding to the demands of the American Colonies‚
· when, bowed down by years and infirmity like Appius, but roused like him
by the dread of approaching dishonour to the English name, he was led by
his son and son-in-law into the House of Lords, and all the Peers with one

impulse rose to receive him.’

22. Et tamen sic. He means, ‘ Yet there can be no doubt of the fact,
for it is positively asserted by tradition?

20. Consilio, auctoritate, sententia, ‘judgment‚ weight of character,
decision.'

23. Tantam domum, tantas clientelas, ‘a large household, a vast
number of dependants! ‘ Tantus’ is used here without any correlative
‘ quantus‚’ which may be supplied in thought ‘ so great a household, as such
a man would have? ‘Clientelas‚’ an abstract term used for the concrete
‘ clientes.’

24. Intentum‚ ‘ ever on the stretch.' We have here the metaphor cou-
tained in the word ‘ intent.'

25. Languescens, ⁶ enfeebled!

27. Metuebant—verebantur. Observe the difference between the
two words: ‘ metuo ' expresses a slavish fear, dreading punishment, ‘ vereor,'
