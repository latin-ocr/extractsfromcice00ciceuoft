331. Repudiatos‚ ‘their proposal was rejected.'

332. Eum. L. Metellus was propraetor of Sicily at the time. ‘His
administration is praised by Cicero for restoring peace and security to the
inhabitants, after the frightful scenes which had been enacted there by
Verres; but he nevertheless attempted, in conjunctior] with his brothers, to
shield Verres from justice, and tried to' prevent the Sicilians from bringing
forward their testimony and complaints against him! Dict. of Biog. vol. ii.
p. 1064.

345. Ei negotium facessitum, ‘that he was in trouble.' Peducaeus

oratio reeta, addressed to the iudices before whom Cicero represents himself
as pleading, inserted parenthetically in the oratio obliqua dependent on
‘ docent,’ which recounts what the Syracusans had said to him. The sentences
beginning with ‘quod ’ are clauses of the preamble of the senatus consultum,
quoted indirectly, and therefore in the subjunctive.

376. Hospitium publice fieret, that is, that L. Cicero should be
formally voted ‘hospes’ of the state. ‘Hospitium' is a formal bond of
sacred friendship. ἰ

man who made the appeal!

403. In ius, ‘into court‚' ‘to have the matter decided.'

409. Enimvero is here ironical‚ ‘ forsooth:
