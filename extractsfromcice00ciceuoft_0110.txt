98 NoTES. 17—

6. Utilitatis speciem, ‘ a plausible appearance of expediency.'

8. Qam calamitatem—gradum. The English order of the Latin
words is ‘ iudicantem [eam] calamitatem quarn accepisset in bello communem
[esse] bellicae fortunae‚’ ‘to regard the defeat which he had met with as part
of the common fortune of war (literally, ‘ common to the fortune of war’),
and maintain his position of consular dignity.’ Calamitatem is in the
relative clause, instead of being in the main one, dependent on ⁶ iudicantem.’
In such sentences it would be perhaps more usual to find a demonstrative, as
’ earn‚' inserted in the main sentence. Calamitatem in bello =‘ defeat’:
⁶ calamitas' is by itself a general word for disaster. It is probably derived
from ‘cado‚’ the change of ‘l ’ for ‘ d ’ being common in Latin, e. g. ⁶ sella'
from ‘ sedeo,’ ‘palam’ from ‘pando,' ‘ scala' from ‘scand0,' ‘lacrima’ compared
with Gr. δάκρυ.

with the brute creation).
