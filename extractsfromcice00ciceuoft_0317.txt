11. 5· RoME'S RULE OF ΗΕΒ PRovacEs. 297

170. peripetasmata, ‘tapestry,' probably called ⁴ Attalica,’ from one of
the kings of Pergamus, who either introduced or patronised the manufacture.
They belonged to what the Romans called ‘ vestis stragula,' which were used

for spreading over couches, chairs, sofas, Sec.
171. Licuit eodem modo. He means that Verres might have made

a forged entry as he had done before.

172. An litteris pepercisti? ‘Was it too much trouble to write it?

173. Armario. See note on Pt. 1. sect. 2. 8. 5.

179. Dicto audientem. In this phrase ‘ audio' takes a dative, as
being equivalent to a verb of obeyiug.

183. Referret‚ supply ‘in tabulas,’ ‘ make an entry in his accounts:

186. Fuit tanti, ‘it was worth your while.'

187. Haberes quod defenderes, ‘if you had, you would have sorne-
thing to allege in your defence! ‘ Haberes ’ requires to complete the sense
the suppressed clause ‘ si id fecisses,’ which is implied from ‘fuit tanti.'

¹89· Nunc—h abes, ⁸ as it is, you cannot find any way to extricate your-
self from the charge about the tapestry.'

Peripetasmatis. ‘With regard to the dative and ablative plural, it is to
be observed that the (Latinised) Greek words in -ma prefer the termination
-is of the second deelension to —ibus. Thus Cicero and other authors use
poematis, epigrammatis, emblematis, hypomnematis, peripetasmatis, peristro-
matis, toreumatis.' Zumpt, 67. 8.

5. Verres· Agents. How Pamphilus saved his Cups.

11. 5. 1. Haec omnia, ‘ the different works of art which he carried off?

3. Fingere—esse, ‘is, 1 believe, a modeller in wax.’ Busts (imagines)
were usually made in wax, as were also sculptors’ models.

6. Expilasse follows ‘in suspicionem venissent ’ as being equivalent to a
simple verb, otherwise a gerund in -di would be the natural construction, as
a genitive after ⁶ suspicionem.’ The passive ‘to be suspected ’ is necessarily
expressed by a phrase, because the only verb for ‘to suspect ’ is ‘ suspicor,’ a
deponent: ¹ suspicio ’ is never used in that sense, though its participle
‘suspectus ' constantly is.

10. In legationis praedis, ‘ his depredations when he was legatus.'
Verres served as ‘legatus ' to Dolabella, when he was pro-praetor of Cilicia in
80 mc,

13. Graecis pictoribus. These words would in English be attached to
the demonstrative rather than the relative. ‘ These are the Greek painters to
whom‚' &c. Dedisse has no accusative expressed. It may be supplied
from the following sentence from an earlier part of the argument: ⁴ Q Tadius
—tabulas protulit quibus pecuniam se dedisse ostendit!

19. Perdendurn erat, ‘ the owners had to part with-⁹
