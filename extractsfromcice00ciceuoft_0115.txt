-21. ROMAN ANECDOTES. 103

29. Omnium, ‘ for all cases.’

21. 1. Qamdiu. The boast which Cicero utters here is not borne out
by history. In all their wars the Romans were ruthless and unscrupulous.

3. Necessarii. ‘ forced upon us.'

4. Populorum, nationum, ‘civilised nations and barbarous tribes.’
When these two words are used together ‘populus’ means an organised
community with a regular government‚ ‘ natio ' a tribe without such
political organisation.

6. Si defendissent, ‘ by having protected.‘

7. Illud—nominari, ‘ our position then might have been called that οῖ
protectors rather than sovereigns of the world.’

10. Desitum est, ‘ we ceased to regard anything as unjust to our allies.·
The passive of ‘ desino ' is only used in the compound tenses.

12. In illo, ⁸ in his case,' i. e. Sulla’s.

Honestam causam. It is to be remembered that Cicero belonged to
the same political party as Sulla.

13. Hasta posita; as the sign of an auction.

15. Praedam 3 which properly means ‘ booty taken from a foreign
enemy.’

Secutus est. He means the Dictator. Julius Caesar.

16. Impia. Julius Caesar was at the head of the opposite party to that
of Sulla and Cicero, and so Cicero calls his cause ‘ impia,' ‘ unnatural’; that
is, he was waging civil war against his country, which he does not allow in
Sulla's case.

17. Publicaret, ‘confiscated.' Qi has a subjunctive after it here,
because Cicero wishes to leave it apparently ambiguous whom he means,
‘ one who '3 it is therefore consecutive.

18. Iure calamitatis; an ironical phrase. ‘Ius ¹ in such a phrase
means ‘privilege' : instead of giving them any real ‘ ius,' he involved them
all in the same calamity.

19. Ad exemplum amissi imperii, ‘as an instance to show that we
had lost our empire.'

20. Massiliam. Massilia had long been of the greatest service to the
Romans in their wars in Gallia Transalpina. But it shut its gates against
Caesar when he was marching from Italy into Spain to attack the leaders of
the Senatorial party there, at the beginning of the war between him and
Pompey. It was taken after a long siege, and, according to the Roman
custom‚ a model or picture of it was carried in Caesar’s triumph.

Ex ea urbe triumphari, ‘a triumph celebrated over a city.’

25. Impunitates tulissemus, ‘had suffered many crimes to go un-
punished.’

26. A quo—hereditas. This was written soon after Caesar’s death.
·Wh0 has bequeathed his property indeed to only a few heim, but his
ambition has descended to a number of seoundrelsf He means Antonius and
others, who were all striving to succeed to Caesar's power.
