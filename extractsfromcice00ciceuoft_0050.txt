38 No TES. 13-

2. Superiorem illurn Dionysium, ‘the famous Dionysius the Elder?

5. Quid? is constantly used by Cicero as a form of transition, especially
in a string of instances‚ as here. It may be translated ‘agaim’

8. Compunctum notis Threiciis, ‘tattooed like a Thracian.’

13. Nec eum fefellit, i.e. ‘uxor,' ‘nor was he wrong in his suspicions!

14. Pellicatus‚ ‘unfaithfulness.’

17. Non ex insidiis. He is said to have been stoned to death by the
people of Agrigentum, who rose suddenly against him.

18. Hic noster, Julius Caesar. This was written in the year of Caesar’s
death.

20. Demetrium. Demetrius Poliorcetes, son of Antigonus, who got posses-
sion of the throne of Macedonia in the contests among Alexander’s generals.

18. 2. Iidem, ‘ and yet would not make even the slightest sacrifice of
glory.' ‘ Idem’ is equivalent to an adversative particle, like ‘tamen,' when
the two things mentioned are apparently inconsistent.

12. Invidiam timens. Cicero here adopts Xenophon's account of the
battle of Leuctra (Xen. Hell. 6. 4, 5), that Cleombrotus fought, against
his own better judgment, for fear his enemies should accuse him of secretly
favouring the Thebans. There does not seem to be any real foundation for
the charge, which Xenophon was led to make through his partiality for the
Spartans. See Thirlwan, vol. 5, ch. 28.

19. 1. Zenone. Zeno, the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy,
taught that pain was no evil.

2. Deductus est; i.e. ‘de sententia: as below, ‘ was convertedff, Other
readings are ‘ devictus ' and ‘ dedoctus ἰ the last perhaps gives the happiest
sense, ‘ was taught the opposite Iesson.' ‘ A dolore ’z the preposition is used
because pain is, so to speak‚ personified, and regarded as the agent rather
than the instrument, to make a more exact antithesis to ‘a Zenone ’ in the
previous clause.

7. Dedissem‚ esset. The moods and tenses are here remarkable; they
are the forms of oratio obliqua, yet the person of ‘dedissem ' is that of
oratio recta. Dionysius must be considered to be giving in a sort of oratio
obliqua his own thoughts when he abandoned Zeno's theory, and ‘ satis
esset ’ is equivalent to ‘ censebam satis esse.'

11. Epigonis. A play of Aeschylus : the line is not extant in the Greek.
Cicero substitutes for it a line from a translation by Attius, a Roman poet.
Cleanthes applies the verse to Zeno, who was dead.

13. Significabat‚ ‘ alluded to.’

20. Honorificis verbis prosecutus esset, ‘ had addressed him in
complimentary terms.‘ ‘ Prosequor ' is literally ‘ to accompany or attend as a
mark of respect!

22. Committam, ‘ will I allow!

26. Quasi faces doloris admoverentur, ‘when he was tortured by

pain.' The metaphor can hardly be kept in English. ‘ Admovere,' ‘to apply.’
Applying lighted torches was a form of torture.
