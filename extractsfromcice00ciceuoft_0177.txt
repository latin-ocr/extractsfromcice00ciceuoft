45. Plenus, ² a perfect number! He is here using the ternis of
astrology.

46. Summam tibi fatalem confecerint, ‘having brought about the
crisis of your life.' Scipio was 56 in ¹29 13.c. In that year attempts were
made to reverse some of the measures of Tib. Gracchus, and Scipio was
looked up to by the aristocracy as their champion. After a vehement debate
in the Senate, in which he was violently assailed by Carbo, one of the
popular leaders, he went home and retired to his sleeping—room to prepare a
speech for the next day, and in the morning he was found dead in his bed.
It was generally believed that he was murdered, as the context implies.

48. Socii . . . Latini. The various peoples ofItaly were connected with
Rome as allies on different terms. The most favoured of these were called
specifically ‘ Socii 3' the lower class, with inferior privileges, ‘ Latini‚’ or
⁸ nomen Latinum.’ The latter name originated in their standing to Rome in
the same relation in which the Latins did after they had been conquered‚
and had ceased to be on equal terms with the Romans.

51. Impias, ‘ unnatural.’

Propinquorum. This alludes to the common report that Sempronia,
who was Scipio’s wife and Gracchus’ sister, and C. Gracchus, the brother of
Tiberius, had had a hand in the murder.

53. Habeto. Observe the accurate use of the future imperative.

56. Qod quidem fiat. ‘ Qod' is here consecutive, after the negative
⁸ nihil? ‘Qidem‚’ like γε in Greek, marks a limitation‚ ‘nothing, that is,
which takes place on earth?

59. Hinc, literally ⁴ from where 1 am,' i. e. ‘ from heaven.'

62. Paullus. Aemilius Paullus, son of the one who fell in Cannae, sur—
named Macedonicus, as being the conqueror of Perses at Pydna, 168 13.c.
His son was adopted by the son of Africanus Major, and so became P. Cor-
nelius Scipio Aemilianus,

Arbitraremur. The mood implies that this was part of the question
which he asked.

66. Vim lacrimarum, ⁸ a shower of tears.'

70. Sanctissime, ⁸ most revered.'

73. Cuius hoc templum est, ⁴ to whom all this expanse which you see
belongs.' Templum, from ww, the root of Gr. τέμνω, Lat. ⁶ temno‚’ is,
literally, ‘a piece cut off.’ Hence it was used of the region of the sky.
which the augur marked off with his lituus to take observations in, and from
this, apparently, it got the meaning of ‘a wide open space‚' ‘an expanse,'
especially of the sky, in which sense it is mostly used in poetry, and has a
somewhat archaic sound, the instances quoted being mostly from Ennius and
Lucretius. It is used for the universe in Lucr. 5. 143 5 ‘ caeli magnum et
versatile ·templum.' Its common meaning, ‘ a temple‚' comes from the
same original meaning, being literally, ‘ a place cut off and set apartss

74. Istis custodiis, ‘from your present confinement.'

76. Qui tuerentur, ‘to keep in order! Qi is here final.
