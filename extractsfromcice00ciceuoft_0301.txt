1. ROME'S RULE OF HER PROVINCES. 281

196. Qid enirn ei praecipiam quem, &c., ‘for why should Ι lay
down rules for one whom ?’ &c. ‘ Praecipiam’ is a deliberative conjunctive.

205. Qae quum—necesse est, ‘these things are creditable indeed
in our private and every—day lise here, but in so high a command, where
morals are so depmved, in a province so full of temptations, they cannot but
seem more than human?

208. Haec institutio, ‘these rules?

211. Susceptas habemus. This circumlocution is not to be regarded
as a mere substitute for the perfect: it always implies more emphatically the
present existence of the state expressed by the verb. ·ἔχω is used in the same
way in Greek. In Latin it is most commonly used with verbs signifying
‘to know' or ‘to resolve.' 1t is the first trace in Latin of what grew in
later times to be the regular usage, from which French and the other Romance
languages have derived their method of forming perfect tenseS, which we also
use in English.

Paeonii nescio cuius. ‘ a fellow called Paconius.’ ‘Nescio quis ’ is one of
the phrases in Latin which is declined as if it were a single word, like
ἐστὶν ὅς and other phrases in Greek. So we osten speak in English of
‘nobody else’s‚’ for ‘nobody⁷s else.’ Paconius and Tuscenius were, it is plain,
obscure individuaIs, who had made violent complaints against QCicero's
conduct, which had reached his brother’s ears at Rome.

219. Parvi refert, ‘it is of little avail.’

223. Iurisdictione. See Dict. of Ant. sub voce.

224. In qua—expedita est, ‘and in regard ofthis it is easy enough to
have a mere (ipsa) theoretical knowledge of the principles of provincial
administration.' ⁸ Ratio! is ⁶ theory ' as opposed to practice.

226. Non solum—suspicioni, ‘not merely partiality‚ but the very
suspicion of it?

229. C. Octavius. This was the man who was best known for his pto-
consulship os Macedonia; he was the father of the C. Octavius who was
adopted by Julius Caesar, and who afterwards became the emperor commonly
known by his title of Augustus.

230. Apud'quem, ‘in whose court?

Primus lictor, ⁴ the chief lictor.'

23²· Videntur—tueretur< An instance of the common Latin idiom
whereby ‘completed actions (actions supposed to be completed Ρ) in past time
are transferred to the present, by the use of the imperfect instead of the
pluperfect.' Zumpt, Sect. 525. The English idiom requires them to be
translated by pluperfects. It is plain from the context that Octavius’ year of
office was over.

233. Sullani homines. He means those supporters of Sulla who had
taken advantage of the Proscription to get the property of proscribed persons
by betraying or killing them.

240. Tot a u x ilia, ‘so many kinds ofprotection to appeal to.⁹ ‘ Auxilium’
