was a rule that· ne Graecis unquam nisi Latine responsa darent magistratus; ⁹

Valerius Maximus, quoted by Long.

412. Tum multa—dicere, ⁴1 remember many things that 1 said, and
this among the rest.'

413. Facile, ‘quite.'

416. Quicum optime convenisset, ‘though he had been on the best
of terms with him‚' i.e. had no personal grounds for refusing him his
testimony.

418. Qod ubi. On this ‘quod’ see note above on l. 112. Here it
admits of explanation as=et ubi hoc intellexi.

419. Tabulas non commendaticias sed tributarias. ‘Litterae
commendaticiae’ were formal letters of introduction or recommendation,
which were constantly given; ‘litterae tributariae’ is a phrase coined by
Cicero to suggest that the communications which Metellus received from
Verres offered him some substantial consideration if he would try to quash
the charges against him. Cicero had mentioned previously that Metellus at
his first coming to Sicily had taken a strong line against Verres, but after
a while, on the receipt of certain letters from Verres, had entirely changed
his policy, and did everything to hinder the prosecution. It might be trans-
lated perhaps ‘ letters, not of introduction, but of credit.'

420. Impetum—facio, ‘ Ι endeavour to tal-:e forcible possession of the
documents.’

422. Tamen, ‘ in spite of all.'

425. Theoractum. Θεορακτός, literally ‘godstruck,' was a nickname
formed on his name Theomnastus. The fondness of both Greeks and
Romans for broad personalities is well known.

430. Copulati, ‘clinging to one another.’ In ius, ‘into court.’

434. Legem? The law of Rome, which gave a prosecutor, officially
appointed in a public prosecution, the right to insist ou the productiori of all
documents which were required in evidence.

435. Fieri potestatem is the passive of the phrase ‘ facere alicui potest-
atem rei‚' ‘to give anyone the right to anything.’

436. Nihil—pertinere, ‘that he had nothing to do with our laves?

Negare sibi placere, ⁸ said that he would not allow.’

439. Legum sanctionem. The ‘sanctio’ of a law was that which
gave it ratification, i.e. the penalty which it imposed on those who violated
it. Poenam is therefore a mere synonym of ‘ sanctionem? They are not
two different things, but two names for the same thing.

441. Qi-—de clamasset, ‘ after having declaimed.’ ‘ Qi‘ is here equi-
valent to ‘ quum‚’ which ‘ quum’ would be concessive.
