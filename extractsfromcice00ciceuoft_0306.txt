491. De reliqua—dimicare, ¹ that we are not struggling for more
glory which we hope for, but fighting to keep what we have won.’

492. Qae—e st, ‘and we have better cause to maintain it now, than we
had to aspire to it at the beginning!

493. Si mihi—separatum, ‘if my interests were in any way separate
from yourS.'

502. Iis etiam qui futuri sunt; supply ‘hominurn' before ‘qui.'

503. Illorum refers to ‘ qui futuri sunt‚' and is another instance of ⁸ ille'
referring to what is more remote, notin order of words, but in thought. See

above on l. 449. ‘ Their judgment will be the truer, because uninfiuenced.by
detraction and ill-will!

505. Quod si esset, ‘though even if it were 50.'

507. Voluisses is plup. because attached to the imperfects of the hypo-
thetical sentence3 but we should in English more naturally use the perfect,
because Qintus’ intention was not abandoned at the time. It is supposed
to refer to his intention of writing a history of his times, which is alluded to
elsewhere in Cicero’s letters.

508. Prodenda, ‘ to be passed on,' in the sense in which ‘trado' is more
commonly used.

514. Laudarent. Observe that the tense of this verb is ruled by the

⁴ fecisti ² on the principle explained in note on Pt. 2. sect. 4. l. 120.

516. In te. ‘ Te' is the ablative. For the meaning, see note on l. 182.
It may be translated here, ‘ for you.'

522. Tua-delector, ‘like your letters, the better in proportion to their
length.’

528. Tertius actus. As according to Horace’s rule, A. P. 189

‘Neve minor neu sit quinto productior actu

Fabula, quae posci vult et spectata reponi,'
five is the regular number of ‘acts' in a Roman play, we must suppose
Cicero to mean by ‘tertius actus' that which would in this case be the
third and last act of Qintus’ performance, the metaphorical and not the
literal drama. For the sentiment, cp. de Sen. 2 ‘ a qua (natura) non verisimile

est quum ceterae partes bene descriptae sint, extremum actum tanquam at
inerti poeta esse neglectum.'

11. 1. The Claims of the Province of Sicily on Rome.

11. 1. 3. Quum—tum. These two words are never used in good Latin
simply for ‘both—and‚’ but there is always some special emphasis on the
latter clause. even when it is not accompanied‚ as here, by ‘pxaecipue‚‘ or
any like word. ‘ Tum-tum' are often used where the two things are to be
connected on equal terms.
