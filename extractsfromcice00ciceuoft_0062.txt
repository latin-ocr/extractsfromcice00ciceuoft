Intentio depulsio, &c. These are technical terms of rhetoric. ‘In-
tentio: ‘the charge,' ‘accusation‚’ from ‘intendere‚’ in such a phrase as
‘intendere alicui litem: ‘to bring a suit against a person’ : literally, ⁴ to aim
it at him! ‘ Depulsio‚’ ‘ the defence‚' ⁸ ratio,' ‘ the plea‚' ‘ infirmatio: ¹ the
counter-plea,' literally, ‘the weakening of the “ratio‚”’ ‘iudicatio‚' ‘the
question for the jury to decide.'

13. Depulsio est concessio, ‘the defence is to allow the fact!

14. Ea re, ‘ thereby.’

formulae.

19. Necessitudo infertur, ‘the plea of necessity is introduced': the
excuse that the accused ‘ couldn't help it.'

20. Defenditur fecisse. Translate impersonally‚ ‘when it is urged in
defence of the defendant, that he did what he did under compulsion of some
sort.'

was used for charging an enemy’s vessel and staving it in.

state.’

treasury.

31. ῐ. Apud, ‘in‚’ i.e. ¹ in the writings of.' ‘ Apud' is the usual proposi·
tion for introducing quotations. ‘ In’ with the ablative is sometimes used.

Socraticum Aeschinem. A different person from Aeschines the orator.

Aspasia, it is a genuine specimen of his own style of arguing.

and pray‚' &c.

Ut et tu—-nupta sit, ‘y0u‚ to be the husband of the very best possible
wife, and she, to be the wife of the very best possible husband!

34. Videbatur. The natural construction here would seem to be ¹ vide-
retur‚' as it is merely a supposedcase, which had not happened. But the
indicative is used because ‘videor‚’ like ⁴ oportet‚’ ‘ debeo,’ ‘possum‚' and
such words, in itself expresses something which is not really the case. ¹
