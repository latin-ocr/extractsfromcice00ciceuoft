1. ROME'S RULE οτι· HER PROVINCES. 289

68. Illum annum. This is explained to refer to the year 80 B. c.‚ when
M. Aemilius Lepidus was Praetor of Sicily. He was succeeded by C. Mar-
cellus, whose integrity is often mentioned by Cicero.

69. Ut salvi esse non possent, ‘that they would not have recovered
from it.’

71. Infinitum imperium. M. Antonius Creticus, the father of
M. Antonius the Triumvir, had a commission with extraordinary powers
in the war with the pirates, extending over all the coasts of the Mediterranean‚
much the same as was afterwards given to Pompeius. He misused it to
plunder the districts over which it gave him control, especially Sicily.

76. Hunc. Verres, the defendant in the suit, is usually called ‘iste,’ as
explained below in note on 1. 80. Here ‘ hunc' is used for the sake of the
antithesis, this present man, as opposed to all who have gone before.

78. Beneficia senatus populique Romani, ‘the favours conferred
on them by the Senate and people.'

80. Istius. ‘Iste,’ in a speech made in a crimina] case, always means
‘the defendant! The speaker is addressing the judices, and ‘ iste’ means
‘the man before you,’ ‘the prisoner at your bar.' In these extracts the
translation may be varied by substituting the name Verres, instead of

’ ⁶ the defendant!

2. The ease of Sopater.

11. 2. 6. Eiusdem rei nomen detulerunt, ‘accused him on the same
charge.' ‘Nomen deferre ad praetorem’ is literally‚ ‘ to carry down a man’s
name to the praetor, sitting in his court‚' which was the first step towards
getting him brought to trial. The praetor was said ‘ nomen accipere ' if he
allowed the case to be tried. Cp. z. 3. 130. Huic Sopatro is dativus
incommodi. Eiusdem rei is genitive after ‘nomen detulerunt: which ἴε
equivalent to a verb of accusing.

12. In primis splendidus atque honestus. It is to be remembered
that the epithets attached to a man’s name when mentioned by a speaker
are merely phrases of courtesy. They often would sound exaggerated if this
were not remembered. They may be compared to the phrases used in the

debates os the English Parliament, e.g. the ‘right honourable gentleman‚'
⁴ the most noble lord,' ⁴ the right reverend prelate,‘ or to such an expression

as ‘our most reilgious and gracious Qeen’ in the Prayer Book, which has
sometimes given offence from this not being understood.
15. Accensus. See note on Letter to Qintu5‚ l. 131.

Idem, ⁶ also‚' ‘ at once.’
16. Priore actione, ‘ on the former hearing.' The plaintiff or prosecutor

was technically said ‘agere,’ and was called sometimes ‘actor‚' and all his
proceedings, speeches‚ examination of witnesses, &c‚ were included under the
term ‘actio.’ This part of the speech was written to be delivered on the
second hearing, the trial having been adjourned.
