*98 NOTES. 25-

22. Relinquere navim. The ‘quid sit’ comes before this, the infini-
tives being used as substantives: ‘ what 'is meant by leaving a ship.’

Navis ipsa quid sit. Such a question would arise as whether the
ship included the boat belonging to it, when being towed behind it. Upon
this would depend whether the owner lost his claim.

25. 1. Sanctum est, perfect passive of ‘ sancio!

2. Dicerentur—essent. Observe these past tenses, dependent on a
principal verb in a perfect tense ; for ‘ sanctum est' is a real perfect, not an
aorist. But this is the true Latin idiom where the result or purpose which
is expressed by the dependent verb is regarded with reference, not to the
whole time represented by the perfect, but to the past act in which it com-
menced. Thus here ‘Sanctum est’ implies ‘Legis lator sanxit’ (aorist),
which would of necessity be followed by the past tenses. They must bev
translated in English by present tenses.

3. Praestari, ‘ be made good!

4. Lingua, ‘ by word of mouth,' ‘in words!

Qae qui. ‘ Quae' is equivalent to ‘ et ea,’ and so ‘ subiret’ is subjunc-
tive because the ‘ quum’ belongs to it, as much as to ⁴ satis esset.' Translate,
‘ and that any one who denied them.’

8. Ut, ‘ for instance?

10. Ea, ‘ those buildings! i.e. those parts of the ‘ aedes.'

Qorurn altitudo officeret ζ subjunctive either only because it is oratio
obliqua, ‘ whose height, they said, was in their way when taking the auspices,’
or, perhaps, in a causa] sense, ‘ because their height‚’ ὅτε.

11. Proscripsit‚ ‘ advertised for sale.’ ‘ Proscribo’ is ‘to put up a notice
or list of any kind in public.'

Insulam. Α house standing detached from others was called ‘insula.'
See Dict. of Ant.

15. Qam belongs to ‘ postea.'

Arbitrum illurn adegit=‘egit illurn ad arbitrum‚' ‘compelled him to
submit to arbitration ’; literally, ‘ forced him to go before an arbitrator' : an
old construction.

16. Quidquid sibi, &c. This clause is a part of the formula of sale.v
whereby the seller gave a kind of warranty that he had dealt fairly and
honestly by the purchaser. The sentence is elliptical. It means, ‘ brought
him before an arbitrator, in reference to the words ‘quidquid sibi‚’ &cf i.e.
to decide whether he had fulfilled the engagement made in thern.

17. Huius nostri Catonis. Cato of Utica, Cicero’s contemporary.

18, Ut enim. It was usual to describe a Roman citizen by giving his
father’s praenomen after his own name. See an instance in ξ 9, and below,
ξ 26. So this Cato would be formally described as M. Porcius Cato M. F.
i. e. Marci Filius.

Illud lumen, ⁸ that luminary,' i. e. ⁴ that illustrious man.'

19. Is igitur, ‘ he. I sav.’ ‘ Igitur¹ is used to resume the narrative after
a parenthesis,
