34 NOTES. 5—

more generally given as Pythias. Damon and Pythias are proverbial in·
stances of true friendship. They are quoted, along with the other classical
instances, in the following passage from Scott's Fortunes of Nigel, ch. 16:
‘You seem to have imagined, my lord, that you and Iwere Pylades and
Orestes—a second edition of Damon and Pythias—Theseus and Pirithous at
the least! The student of the Bible will add to these David and Jonathan.

4. Commendandorum suorum causa, ‘that he might commit his
family to the protection of others.'

5. Vas factus est alter eius sistendi, ‘the other became bail for his
appearance? ‘ Sistere‚’ as a legal term, is either ‘to cause to appear‚’ or,
in a middle sense, ‘ to put in an appearance.'

5. 1. Oeconomico, ⁴ The Householder.’ A treatise by Xenophon on the
management of a household, and of property generally.

4. Venisset ad eum Sardis. Observe the difference of the Latin and
English idiom. We say, ‘came to him at Sardis': the Latin is, literally.
¹ came to him to Sardis.’

5. A sociis. By ‘ socii ' here are meant the Peloponuesian league against
Athens. Towards the close of the Peloponnesian war, 407 B.C., Lysander
was sent from Sparta to take the command on the coast of Asia, to oppose
Alcibiades, who was at the head of the Athenian forces. He was an officer
of great diplomatic talents, and was especially commissioned to gain the
favour of Cyrus, brother of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, who was then in
supreme command on the coast of Asia Minor.

9. Qincuncem. ⁸ Qincunx’ ( = ‘ quinque unciae‚’ or twelfth parts of an
‘ as') is used here for a common method of planting trees, whereby the alternate
rows were placed opposite the centre of the space between those in the preced-

ing and following ones, so that they resembled the ⁶ five' on dice, thus, ⁴

The name is said to be taken from V, the Roman five, half the above figure
in any direction being in the form of V.

Sub actam. ‘ Subigere’ was a regular agricultural term for ‘ working the
soil,’ as we should say, so as to pulverise it. It is used in Virg. G. Ι. 125
‘ Ante lovem nulli subigebant arva coloni‚' where it is not to be regarded as
a poetical metaphor.

12. Descripta, ¹ arranged.’ ‘ Describo’ is used of any orderly arranging
or classifying. Livy, 1. 42, applies it to Servius Tullius' division of the people,
‘Classes centuriasque et hunc ordinem ex censu descripsit.’ So Cicero, de
Rep. 2. 8, of Romulus, ‘ Populum in tribus tres curiasque triginta descrip-
serat.’

14. Istarum arborum, ¹ the trees you see! ⁴ Iste’ must always have some
reference to the znd person, which it is well to express in construing.

6. 5. Ludis, ‘ at the games‚’ an abl. of time.

8. consederant, an indicative in oratio obliqua, because the clause to
which it belongs is an explanation added by the writer, and so a sort of
parenthesis.
