288 N ο T E S. Sect. v.

Possibly here the subjunctive is suggested by the verb, on which the whole
clause depends, being itself in the subjunctive.

25. Manu ‘ by art! Cp. Caes. B. G. 3. 23 ‘oppidum et natura loci et
manu munitum.' Livy 2. 5 (where he is speaking of an island formed in
the Tiber by an accumulation of various substances), ‘postea credo additas
moles, manuque adiutum, ut tam eminens area esset!

28. Idem, ⁸ at once,’ lit. ‘ it, the same thing!

34. Ut-putaremus, ‘as if we regarded (literally, ‘so as to regard,’)
everything that it could furnish, not as produced there, but rather as stored
up here at home!

36. Deberet, putaret, imperaretur, are subjunctives, because the
interrogatives here are equivalent to negatives‚ and therefore the relative
clauses limit them.

39. Cellam penariam, ‘the granary.’

41. Italico bello, the Social War; called also the Marsic War-

43. Coriis. Long observes, that ⁴ skins were used for tents, shields, and
other military purposes ;’ and thus justifies the reading ‘coriis‚¹ as corre-
sponding to ‘ armavit.’ Another reading is ‘ copiis.'

45. Sentiamus is a conjunctive used potentially: ‘ which possibly we
may not so much as notice.'

46. Multis locupletioribus civibus utimur, 'we find many of our
countrymen enriched! For this use of ‘utor' with an adjective, cp. Ter.
Heaut. 2. 1. 5 ‘ nae ille facili me utetur patre ς’ Cic. Rosc. Am. 26 ‘ ne bestiis
quoque immanioribus uteremur;’ Verr. 5. 59 ‘ vide quam me sis usurus aequo;'
Plaut. Aul. 2. 2. 55 ‘ et te utar iniquiore.'

48. Libenter, ⁴ at their will?

50. Compendio. ‘compendium' from 'con’ and ‘pendo,’ literally,
‘a hanging together‚’ has two leading meanings—r. ‘a laying together‚'
⁸ storing up,’ hence ‘ profit ς’ 2. ‘a laying together‚' in the sense of ⁶ short-
ening‚' ‘abbreviating.' Here it means the former. Cp. de Off. 3. 15 ‘facere
compendii sui causa quod non liceat?

Ut—-libeat‚ ‘ to keep corn- or grazing-farmS, or to trade, according to
their fancy!

57. Sic—provinciae, ⁸ so this province is like a pleasant suburban
villa to the Roman people.’ The wealthy Romans had most of them a
‘ suburbanum,' i. e. an estate with a house on it in the country near to Rome,
besides their more distant country houses. Cicero means that Sicily was to
the State in comparison of the other provinces as a ‘suburbanum' of an
individual compared to his other estates.

58. Quae nunc increbuit, ⁶ which is now in fashiom'

65. Publicanus. See Dict. of Ant. sub voce.

66. Ita belongs to ‘ tulerunt,' not to ‘multorum'

67. Publico consilio. He means that though there had been cases
where individuals or separate towns had appealed to Rome, yet that the
province as a whole had never before claimed protection.
