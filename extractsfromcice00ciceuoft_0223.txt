Sect. IV. ARGUMENT AGAJNST PROVIDENCE. 203

stance. Apollodorus was a tyrant of Cassandreia, formerly Potidaea, in Pallene.
He lived in the earlier part of the third century Ec. He is thus described
by Polyaenus, τύραννος ἐγένετο φονικώτατος καὶ ὠμότατος πάντων, ὅσοι
παρ’ Ἕλλησιν ἢ παρὰ βαρβάροις ἐτυράννησαν.

Multis quidem ante cruciatis et necatis, ‘yes, but not till they
had first tortured and put to death numbers:

36. Anaxarchum. Anaxarchus was a philosopher, a native of Abdera.
He was a friend of Alexander the Great‚ and accompanied him to
Asia.

37. Cyprio tyranno. Nicocreon, kIng of Salamis in Cyprus. Accord-
ing to the story, Anaxarchus had offended Nicocreon, when visiting Alex-
ander, and when Anaxarchus fell into his hands by being wrecked on his
coast, he pounded him to death in a mortar.

Zenonem. Not the famous Stoic philosopher, who was a native of Citium
in Cyprus, but an earlier philosopher, who also took part in the politics of his
native city, Elea, or Velia, on the west coast of Lucania. He is said to
have perished in an attempt to deliver his city from a tyrant, but the details
are uncertain.

40. Discrimen, ‘ distinction between good and bad.’

44. Contra deos testimonium dicere, i. e. he was a living proof that
the gods could not cate for man.

56. Qum· id—diceret, ‘as that, he said, was suitable all the year
round! The ‘ quum' really belongs to ‘ esse’ and not to ‘ diceret,' which is
superfluous. Cp. Pt. 1. Sect. 2. 125 12. 45, 90.

60. Pater. Apollo.

61. Quod—esset. Subjunctive as being oratio obliqua, included in
the words attributed to Dionysius.

63. Victor101as, ‘little figures of Victory.' It was common for statues
of the gods to be made with outstretched hands, holding out little figures of
Victory, or garlands. An instance occurs in Pt. 3. 11. ch. 12, l. 65, p. 255,
where a statue is described as representing Ceres, holding in her hand a
figure of Victory.

67. Precaremur, subjunctive because in oratio obliqua.

70. Qud—haberet, ‘ anything that any one had which belonged to the
gods.’

76. Atque. We should perhaps rather have expected ‘ at’ here : but the
copulative particle is preferred to the adversative, because his dying in his
own bed is a further degree of good fortune, beyond, rather than contrasted
with, his escaping everything which could be regarded as a punishment from
heaven.

78. Hereditatis loco, ‘as an heir-loom!

Invita in hoc loco versatur oratio, ⁸ 1 dwell unwillingly on this
topic!

79. Auctoritatem peccandi, ‘ encouragement to do wrong.’ See note
on ⁴ auctor' Pt. 1. Sect. 1. 1.
