—24. GREEK A NEC'DOTES. 43

prophet Tiresias declared that the Thebans would conquer if Menoeceus
sacrificed himself for his country, which he did.

56. Nostros: the Roman heroes.

23. 2. Haberetur. The mood implies that it was part of the question,
not an explanation put in by the writer. The question was whether Arche-
laus, being in general estimation ‘ fortunatissimus‚’ the luckiest of men, was
not proved thereby to be ‘ beatus: truly happy.

5. Ain tu, i. e. ‘ aisne,' ⁸ do you say so?⁷ i. e. ‘ what do you mean ’θ’ τί
δαίς in Plato.

9. An ego possim, one half of a conditional sentence, the other, ‘si
tentem‚’ or some such phrase, being implied. ‘ How could 1?’

16. In epitaphio, ‘in his funeral oration? ‘ The Menexenus ' of Plato,
from which this is quoted, contains a funeral speech which Socrates relates
as having been spoken by Aspasia, but which contains his own sentiments.
The previous dialogue is translated from Plato’s ⁴ Gorgias,⁹

17. Cui—comparata est, ‘the man who has everything which tends
to make life happy attached to himself, instead of their being dependent
on the good or bad fortune of others, and so obliged to follow what happens
to others and shift with them, this man has attained the true method of
living well.'

21. Ille moderatus, ‘ the true good man,' the man who hits the '
golden mean. ‘ Moderatus ’ is the translation of the Greek σώφρων.

Et nascentibus et cadentibus, ‘whether they come or go?

25. Spem sui, ‘hopes for himself.'

24, Ι. Diodotus was a friend of Cicero’s, and lived with him. He died
in Cicero’s house, and left him his property.

2. Esset: the conditional clause is omitted. ‘Si quis diceret’ or some
such clause is implied.

Quum—tum, ⁴ not only—but also!

3. Fidibus uteretur, ‘played on the lyre.’ Music occupied an im-
portant place in the training of the disciples of Pythagoras, and many of
their speculative theories and moral doctrines were founded ou the laws of
harmony. '

6. Geometriae munus tuebatur, ‘he taught geometry,’ ‘was a pro-

fessor of geometry.'
7. Unde, quo, ‘ from what point and to what point ?’

8. Asclepiadem. Nothing is known of him beyond what Cicero
mentions here.

10. Puero ut uno esset comitatior, ‘that he had one boy more to
attend on him,’ i. e. than he would have had otherwise. Literally‚ ‘ that he
was more attended by (in the degree of) one boy.’ ‘ Puero’ is ‘ablativus
mensurae,' or as it is also called, of quantity or of difference. It is to be
carefully distinguished from the abl. of comparison.

11. Sit si liceat, ‘ would be, if it were allowed.’ The full sentence would
be ⁴ si liceat id facere quod licet quibusdam Graecis.' He means begging.
