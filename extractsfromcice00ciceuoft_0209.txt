Seet. 1v. ΒΕΑ UTJES OF NA TURE. 189

50. Qarum motus—insistunt, ‘ moving sometimes quicker, sometimes
slower, sometimes standing still!

55. Qarurn ita descripta distinctio est, ‘so accurately arranged
in separate divisions! It is impossible to translate an abstract substantive
like ⁴ distinctio' literally in such a passage as this. ‘ Distinguo’ is ⁶ to mark
off by a seratched or dotted line.’ For ⁴ descripta’ see note on Pt. 1. Sect. 1.
5. 12.

54. Notarum figurarum. He is referring to the way in which the
Greeks mapped out the stars into figures of men and animan, giving them
names by which they are still commonly known.

56. Casu et temere, ‘by chance and at random.’ ‘ Casu’ is the more
general word, ⁴ temere' always marks the absence of design or plan.

59. Sed intelligi qualia sint non possunt, ⁴ but whose nature cannot
be understood?

62. Appareat is subj., as being consecutive, after a question which is
equivalent to a negative.

65. Ea quae radicibus continentur, ‘everything which is connected
with the earth by roots.' Cp. below 1. 160, ‘omnium rerum, quae a terra
stirpibus continerentur.’

Libro aut cortice. ‘Liber' is the inner bark or rind, ‘cortex’ the
outer.

71. Qanta ad eam rem vis, ut, ‘ how much is done to make them,’
&c.
75. Effugia pennarum, ‘wings to escape with,’ contrasted with the
horus which are given for defence.

78. Conficiendum, ‘to chew it.’ Cp. below l. 230 ‘adversi dentes
dividunt escaS, intimi autem conficiunt! Livy 2. 32, in the account of the
fable of the Belly and th‘e Members, ‘ conspirasse inde (Membra) ne manus
ad os cibum ferrent, nec os acciperet datum, nec dentes conficerent.’

79. Sollers subtilisque. ‘ Sollers' is derived from ⁴ sollo,' an Oscan
word meaning ‘ whole‚' and ⁴ ars,¹ aud so means literali y ⁴ elever at all things‚'
then generally, ⁶ clever,' ‘ ingenious.’ ‘ Subtilis ’ is a contractiori of ⁶ subtextilis‚’
and means literally‚ ⁴ woven fine,’ ‘ fine spun,’ and thence generally applied
to anything that is minute, fine, precise, delicate, nearly = Gr. λεπτός.

80. Qae quidem intus inclusa sunt, ‘ at least, all the internal parts:

88. Unguium tenacitate, aduncitate rostrorum, ‘ with griping
talons,' ‘ with hooked beaks.’ Observe again the abstract substantives.
See above on l. 53.

89. Carpum, ‘browse.’ ‘Carpo' is properly applied to graminivorous
animals only. It is probably connected with the same root as ⁴ rap—io'
and Gr. ἆρπ-άζω.

Alia vorant, alia mandunt, ‘some swallow their food whole, some
masticate it.'
