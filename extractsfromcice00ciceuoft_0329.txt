11. 13. ROME’S RULE OF HER PROVINCES. 309

137. Id, instead of ‘ eas‚' referring to and repeating the ⁴ hastas’ after the
long parenthesis. Insert in English ‘ I say.’

139. Nam, here, as several times before, is to be explained by an ellipse,
such as, ‘I need not say much about the Sappho, sor it,' &a

145. Beati, ‘wealthy;’ delicati, ‘daiuty.'

148. Monumentum Catuli, ‘the temple built by Catulus to record his
victory! This was a temple of Fortuna, built by Q Lutatius Catulus, to
commemorate his victory over the Cimbri at Vercellae 101 13.c.

149. In alicuius istorum Tusculanum, ‘the country-seat of Verres
or some of those like him,' ite. rnen who adorned their houses with plunder
which they brought from their provinces. Tusculum was a favourite place
for the villas of the wealthy Romans. Cicero had one there himself later in
his life. Tusculanum agrees with ‘praedium’ understood.

Forum ornatum, ‘the forum when decked out‚' i. e. by the aediles
for some great festival or show. See above on 2. 4. 35.

152. Huius operarii, ‘a coarse fellow like this.' ⁶ Will you let a coarse
fellow like this have his tastes and fancies?' Cicero turns suddenly from
irony to violent direct invective.

155. Ad ferenda signa, i.e. to be a portet.

159. Qod—sustulisset. The difficulty of this sentence consists in
this, that ‘quod,’ which was originally intended to be the accusative of the
verb, is superseded by the ‘ unam literam,’ which is joined with the verb. It
is an anacoluthon ζ the sentence should have ended in this sort of way, ⁶ quod
-si intellexisset‚' then to add more force to his description of Verres'
ignorance, he inserts the ‘ unam literam Graecam,' to the derangement of the
grammar of the sentence, which is sacrificed to the vehernence of the
invective. Care must be taken not to translate the sentence as if ‘quod'
were accusative after ‘ sustulisset! lt will be best to substitute a conjunction
for ‘quod.' The sentence may illustrate the idiom noticed above in ‘ quod
si‚' and such phrases, showing how a relative is introduced as a connecting
link, even where its full force is superfluous.

168. Οὔριον. The Greek Ζεὺς Οὔριοε, ‘the-god of favourable weather!
He is changed by the Romans into Jupiter Imperator, probably because they
had no title of Jupiter which corresponded to Οὔριοε.

173. Aristaeus, as being one of the deities connected with agriculture,
is joined in worship with Liber or Bacchus.

185. Ita—ut, the force of the particles is this, ‘This one Flamininus
took away, it is true, from the temple it belonged to, but only to place it in
the Capitol.'

186. Emerserint—invecta sint. ⁴ Einerserint’ refers to offensive
wars waged by those who lived ou the shores of the Euxine beyond their
own coasts, so that they had to corne out of it (emergere) to wage them;
‘invecta sint* to those in which the Romans had invaded their territories,
and entered the Euxine to do so. The first war with Mithridates, King of
Pontus, is an instance of the former ki11d3 while iu the third, Mithridates
