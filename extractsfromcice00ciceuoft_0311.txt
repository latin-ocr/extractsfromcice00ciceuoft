11. 3. ROME’S RULE OF HER PROVINCES. 291

75. Quod conflaret. ‘Conflaret' is subj. as being virtually oratio
obliqua, being the reason Verres gave for his attack on him.

77. Negotiaretur. This and the following verbs are subj. because ‘ qui'
is consecutive. It should be translated ⁵ a man who!

78. Ita—ut—deperderet, literally, ‘ that he ought to make money in the
province in such a way as not in any way to sacrifice his liberty;’ more
idiomatically‚ ‘that he ought not to make money in the province at the
least sacrifice of his liberty!

84. Importunitate‚ ‘outrageous,’ turning the ablative of quality into
an adj.

86. Si dimisisset is oratio obliqua of ‘si dimisero‚' and therefore is in
the plup. It must be translated in English ‘ if he dismissed!

92. Aestuabat, ‘was tossed‚' keeping in English the metaphor of the
Latin. Sometimes it is used without any ablative to express vacillatiou.
e. g. Hor. Ep. 1. 1, 99

‘Mea si pugnat sententia secum,
Aestuat, et vitae disconvenit ordine tot0.'

98. Se demittebat ad aurem, ‘stooped and whispered to him!

102. Dixisse. The crier’s word was ‘dixerunt,⁸ ‘they have spoken,'
i. e. ‘ the case is over!

106. De sententia, ‘on the verdict?

Scribae, medici. haruspicis, is an ironical description of the few of
Verres' creatures who were left in the court.

3. T he Case of Sthenius,

11. 3. 9. Ex aere et Deliacam et Corinthiam. ‘Aes,' when applied
to works of art, means a composition of metals, of which copper is the
chief ingredient. Delos and Corinth were each of them famous for their
own mixture, which was used in the making of the choicest works of art.
See Dict. of Ant. under ‘ Aes,' and note on Pt. 1.>Sect. 2. 15. 35.

11. Ferebant. ‘Fero' is commonly used in phrases of this sort, with
‘ ut' or ‘pro ut' or other particles, in the sense of ⁴ to allow‚' ot ⁴ to require?
the expressions being often equivalent to ‘ according to,' ‘in proportion to‚'
‘to the best of,’ e. g. ‘ut fert illorum opini0,’ · according to their notion.'
Caes. Β. G. 5. 13. Translate here ‘in proportion to the means of a native
of Thermae! Cp. Pt. 2, Scipio's Dream, l. 133, ‘natura fert, ut,’ &c.

13. Adventus is the official term for the entry of a governor into his
province ; nostrorum hominum means, of course, Roman citizens. The
whole clause may bc rendered, ‘Not for his own pleasure so much, as in
order to be able to entertain our folk, or to welcome them on their official
entry into the place.'

23. Adamavit. The ‘ad’ in ‘adamo' is intensive. This is not a
common meaning of ‘ad’ in composition, but it follows naturally enough from
its meaning of ‘in addition to.'
