r. RoME’S RULE OF HER PROVINCES. 285

440. Quum—difficile est, ‘is difficult indeed in any character, but
specially so when one has reached (iam) our age.³

442. Evellere. Cp. Hor. Ep. 1. 14. 4, 5

‘Spinas animone ego fortius, an tu
Evellas agro.'

443. Illud, literally, ‘that other point,' as contrasted with the one just
mentioned: the English idiom would require ‘this,’ i. e. the one follow-
ing.

Ut. Observe that the ⁸ ut’ is repeated, owing to the intervention of two
clauses between ‘admoneo’ and its final clause.

444. Observe the force of ‘ ob' in ‘ occupatur’ which is very much lost in
our derivative ‘ occupy.’ ⁸ Occupo' is to take possession of anything so as to
keep out some one else.

449. Illud here refers to the one which is nearest mentioned, viz. ‘ omnino
non irasci,’ because the other is the one with which he is more immediately
concerned here. The common mle, that ‘ hic’ refers to the nearest, ⁶ ille’ to
the furthest off, may hold good, if it be remembered that nearness need not
always be nearness in order of words, but may sometimes mean nearness in
regard of thought: otherwise, though the rule may hold good in nine cases
out of ten, it will fail at the tenth. See also note on 1. 503.

450. Lentitudinis, ‘want of sensibility;' ‘ lentus’ is an easy-going cha-
racter, who is not put out of his way by circumstances.

452. Motum animi, ‘your excitement.'

454. Commodiorem, ‘less disagregable!

458. Iracundiae. The plural of the abstract term here, as usually,
means ‘ instances‚’ ‘cases ofiiracundial The general sense of the sentence is
this—⁴ If you persist in what you decide in fits of passion, you will be called
“acerbus‚'’ harsh; if you retract when the fit is over, you will be called
“ levis,” fickle.¹

460. Ut in malis, ‘ as a choice of evils!

471. Quod si—essent, ‘if we were in a position in which little would
be talked or said about us.’ ‘Sermonis’ and ‘praedicationis’ are genitives
of respect.

477. Ea nostra ratio est, ‘ our position is such.'

478. Quum faveant, tum etiam, &c., ‘ are on our side indeed, but
also‚' &c.

482. Es sortitus. Ihave here inserted Orelli's conjecture, in a passage
which without emendation is unintelligible.

483. Celebritate. This and the other ablatives are ablatives of respect.

485. significationes, ‘expressions of opinion,’ either applause or the
reverse.

486. His rebus and illa omnia are not opposed here. They both
refer to what hasjust been mentioned, only ‘illa omnia' is the more inclusive
of the two, and refers not only to them, but everything else of the kind.

488. In magistratibus, i. e. both as consul and as praetor.
