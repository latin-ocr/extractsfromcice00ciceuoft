NOTES.

1. 1. Roges-utar. This is a conditional sentence, with ‘ si ’ omitted in
the protasis or conditional clause: it is in full ‘si roges—utar.' This is a
common construction in Latin, with either ind. or conj. in the protasis, ac-
cording as they would be used if the ‘ si' were inserted. E. g. ‘ Rides, ma-
iore cachinno concutitur' (i. e. 6 si rides ’) Juv. 3. 100. ‘ Tu quoque magnam
Partem opere in tanto, sineret dolor, Icare, haberes ’ (i. e. ‘ si sineret dolor ')
Virg. Ae. 6. 30. In English we usually substitute a question, ‘ Do you ask,
&c. ἱ) ’ Observe that ‘ utar’ is conj. pres„ not fut. ind.

Auctore utar Simonide, ‘1 should follow the example of Simonides!
⁴ Auctor’ from ‘ augeo‚’ lit. ‘ one who makes to grow‚’ is used for ‘ an originator’
in various senses: here, one whose example originales a particular line of
conduct in another.

3. Deliberandi unum diem, ‘ one day for consideration!

2. Ι. Praeclare accusat, ‘ blames in admirable terms.'

2. Quod consectetur, 6 for courting‚’ subj. as being virtually oratio
obliqua, giving the reason which Philip assigned for his blame.

3. Malum 3 used as an interjection, expressive of indignation. It is a col-
loquial expression, more common in Plautus and Terence than elsewhere. It
is always used with questions : e. g. Ter. Phorm. 4. 5. 11 ‘ Qid tua, malum,
id refert? ‘ Plague on you, what 's that to you ?'

5. 6 Id agis ut——sp erent? ' 6 is it your object that the Macedonians should
hope ?’ ‘do you want to make the Macedonians hope P’

6. Bene ministrum et praebitorem: supply 6 dicit! ‘He is right in
using the terms “ minister '’ and 66 praebitor.’' ²

3. 4. Interdici, here used impersonally with da‘t. of person, ⁸ patribus‚' and
abl. of thing, 6 bonis! When used personally, it usually takes, in the act.
voice, (1) a dat. of person and acc. of thing, as, ‘feminis purpurae usum
interdicemus? ‘shall we forbid ladies to wear scarlet?' Liv. 34. 7: (2)
sometimes the same construction as here, as, ‘Ariovistus omni Gallia Ro-
manis interdixisset’ Caes. B. G. 1. 46. Translate, 6 as fathers who mis-
manage their property are usually deprived of the control of it! Observe
that 6 solet' with an impersonal verb becomes also impersonal.

9. Sententiis iudicum, ‘by the votes of the jury': the ‘ iudices' at
Rome, and, in some respects, the δικασταί at Athens, who are here meant
by 6 iudices‚' corresponded more nearly to our own jurymen than to judges.
