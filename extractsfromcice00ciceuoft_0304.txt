373. Praesertim publicis male redemptis, ‘especially as they have
made a bad bargain in their contract for the taxes,’ i. e. have over—estimated
the amount of them, and so have bid more than they are really worth.

380. Sulla. XVhen Sulla was in the Province of Asia during the war with

384. Attributae‚ ‘attached.'

396. Possunt—molestiae. By ‘lex censoria’ are meant the conditions
on which the censors let the taxes to the publicani. Cicero is here
suggesting a kind of compromise between the strict justice which was due
to the provincials‚ and the interests of the publicani, whom he did not wish
his brother to offend. His brother is to suggest to the provincials, that, in
making their bargains with the publicani, they had better not insist rigidly
on the terms which the censors had fixed, but consider the advantage of
getting the matter settled without dispute.

402. Gratia atque auctoritate. ‘ Gratia' is ‘ personal influence,' that
which a man has from his own individual character, ⁶ auctoritas ’ is ⁴ official
influence,’ that which he has in virtue of his position. In this sentence
Cicero means to suggest to his brother that, without using any actual coni-
pulsion, he might ask it as a favour of the provincials, to give the publicani
what they ask, and not force him into collision with thern.

403. Sed et. The ‘ et’ is out of its place, as the two relative clauses
both refer to the same set of people. Its proper place is before ‘ de quibus.’

410. Societates‚ ‘ companies.’ These were associations of publicani,
who combined to take the contracts. See Dict. of Aut. under ‘ Publicani.'

412. Voluntate coniungere, ‘ to unite in goodwilL’

pressed hypothetica! clause, ‘ I would wish, if the time were not passed?

420. Istinc, ‘ from where you are,' ‘ from your province.’

Ita—ut. The force of the particles is best expressed by turning ⁴ omnes'
at the beginning of the sentence into a negative. ‘ None of those who come,
&c., make mention of your goodness, &c., without making one exception
from the high praise they give you, namely, your hasty temper-⁹

431. Deferunt ad nos, ‘ bring us word.’

of good breeding.'
