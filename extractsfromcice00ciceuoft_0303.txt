1. ROME’S RULE OF HER PROVINCES. 283

288. Vectigali aedilicio. These were contributions enforced from the
provinces towards the enormous expenses of the public shows given by the
curule aediles. They were apparently originally voluntary contributions‚
but gradually carne to be compulsory.

Cum magnis nostris simultatibus, ‘not without our incurring great
enmities in consequence.'

291. HS cc. This would naturally stand for 200 sestertii: with a line
over the cc (thus, ὃὸ) it would represent sestertium ducenties, = 20,000‚000
sestertii. The one sum is too small, the other too large for the case. 200
sestertia: 200‚000 sestertii, would be such a sum as would suit the context,
and we must therefore consider HS as here used for sestertia.

204. Qiod—laudatur, ⁴ which, however it may be taken in Asia, in
Rome is received with very great approval.’

296. Ad templum monumentumque nostrum, ‘to build a temple as
a memorial of our services.¹ Cp. Pt. 2. ch. 6. 190, where see note on
‘ monumentum Marii?

306. Ferrent. The object of ‘ ferrent' is suggested by the context.

plaint if such honours were refused to them.

338. Deducendo, ⁸ bringing you home‚’ i. e. ‘ securing your recall!

344. Temporis causa, ‘on grounds of expediency.' Cp. l. 167 ‘tui
amantiorem quam temporis!

Essent, constituerentur, tribuerentur. These must not be mistaken
foi-impossible hypothetical sentences, such as are put in the imp. subj. on their
own account : they are the ‘ oratio obliqua ⁵ of hypothetical sentences with

pres. ind. sunt, constituuntur, tribuuntur.

346. Existimabam. The force of the tense here is, ⁴1 told you when I
wrote, that Ι thought,' &c. It is connected in thought with ‘ quid sentirem
scripsi ad te antea ' above. Of course it is not to be taken to imply that he
does not think so still.

357. De nobis optime meritum. The publicani as a moneyed class
had naturally supported Cicero against Catiline‚ who wished to bring about a

general bankruptcy.

them to support the side which he considered the constitutional one, that of
the ‘ optimates!
367. Inductione animi. ⁴ resolution! This sense of ⁴ inductio’
