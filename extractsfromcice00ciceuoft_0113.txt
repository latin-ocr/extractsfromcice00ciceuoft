..20. RoMAN ANECDOTES. 101

3 specimen of older Latin poetry than that of virgil and Horace and the
writers of the Augustan age. Mi is an old contraction of ‘mihi’

41. Cauponantes bellum, ‘higgling over war’; from ‘caupona,' a
shop·keeper: cp. Aesch. Theb. 545

ἐλθὼν δ’ ἔοικεν οὐ καπηλεύσειν μάχην.

42. Cernamus, ‘decide,' in which sense the compound ‘decerno’ is more
commonly used in later Latin.

43. Hera fors, ‘Darne Fortune.’

46. {orumdem- The first two syllables to be read as one, like
‘yorum em.’

Certum est, ‘I have resolved’: supply ‘ mihi!

47. Dono, ducite, doque. The order of the words is inverted, ‘dono
doque, ducite‚' ‘ I give and present them to you, do ye carry them off!

Volentibu'. A final ‘ s ‘ was often elided in old Latin poetry.

48. Aeacidarum. Pyrrhus boasted of being lineally descended from
Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, who was said to have settled in Epeirus after
the Trojan war, and to have founded a race of kings.

49. Temporibus adductiJ ‘ under stress of circumstances!

53. Non censuit, ⁶ voted against.'

54. Qum retineretur. Cp. Hor. Od. 3. 5, 50

⁶ Dimovit obstantes *propinquos
Et populum reditus morantem!

55. Fidem hosti datam fallere, ‘to break his word when pledged to
an enemy.'

57. Quos decem, the antecedent is ‘eos omnes ’ below. The order of
the Latin sentences rnay be kept by translating ‘quos decem‚’ ‘in regard
to those ten men, whom.'

58. Nisi—impetrassent, ‘unless they induced [the Senate] to let the
prisoners be ransomed.'

(ιο. Qui peierassent: subj. because, as it is stated in ξ 17, it was un-
certain how many of thern were guilty of the perjury, and so ‘ eos qui ' =
such as had. Observe that the antecedent to ‘ quos ’ *is ‘ eos ' not ‘ eorum.’

ln aerariis reliquerunt, ‘kept disfranchised'; literally, ‘left among
the aerarii) For ‘ Aerarii,’ see Dict. of Ant.

61. Qi iurisiurandi fraude culpam invenerat, ‘ who had been
the first to incur the guilt by evading his oath.' With this use of ‘ fraude '
cp, the phrase ‘ fraudem facere‚’ ⁴ to evade.' Liv. 7. 16 ‘ Qod emancipando
filium fraudem legi fecisset.' Plaut. Mil. Glor. 2. 2, 9 ‘Ne legi fraudem
facerent?

63. Nescio quid. ‘ Obliviscor ¹ seldom is used with an acc, : here it is
so used, probably to avoid the arnbiguity of ‘ nescio cuius.’

65. In fide, ‘ in a promise.’ Quid senseris non quid dixeris,
¹ your meaning, not your mere words!

71. Bellum ultro inferentis, ‘the aggressor in the war.'

20. 2. Iaceret, ⁸ did not come forward.’ Iam septimum annum,
