n.6. ROME'S RULE OF HER PROVINCES. 299

How Diodorus was robbed.

11. 6. 2. Multos iarn annos habitat, ‘has been living these many
years.' The form of expression combines both past and present.

3. Quo, here=ad quos.

4. Gratiosus, ‘influentiaL'

5. Toreumata‚ ‘specimens of chased work! Τορευτική is the Greek
term corresponding to the Latin ‘ caelatura‚’ and they both express the art of
ohasing in the precious metals. See Dict. of Ant„ ⁴ Caelatura.’

Thericlea‚ ‘in the style of Thericles.' He was an artist of Corinth,
whose works were famous, and called Θηρίκλεια or Θηρίκλειαι κύλικες.
Dict. of Biog. sub voce.

6. Qi—haberet, a causa] sentence, ⁸ as he was loath to lose them.'

14. Nihil ei longius videbatur quarn cum, &c., ‘the time seemed
very long to him, until‚’ i. e. ‘ he could not rest, till!

17. Paucis illis diebus, ⁸ a few days before!

26. Ut opinor—gemmis, ‘no doubt made of gold and precions
stones,' as these cups of Diodorus were. He is ironicalIy making the parallel
between Eriphyle and Verres as close as possible.

32. Vasa collegerat is a military phrase, like the one it is coupled to.
‘Vasa colligere’ is ‘to pack up the baggage.' Another phrase is ‘vasa
conclamare,' to give the word to pack up the baggage. See Caes. B. G. 1. 66.
The two clauses may be reversed in English, ‘had packed up his baggage and
marched out of Sici1y,’ or the order may be kept by rendering ‘ had marched
out of Sicily with bag andbaggagef

33. Rationem—ratio. There is a play on the double meaning of the
word. ‘ Rationem’ means ⁶ plan ;' ‘ ratio‚’ standing in antithesis to ‘ amentia,’
means ‘ sanity.' The English word ‘ reason' will render both. ⁴ He devises
the following reason for recalling him to Sicily, if it should not rather be
called loss of reason than reason.'

35. Apponst, ‘ he sets at him.'

37. Reum, supply ‘ esse!

44. Sordidatus, ‘in mean attire.' This was the custom of persons in
such danger as Diodorus was, in order to excite pity, and induce their
friends to take up their cause.

47. Videret. Oratio obliqua of the imperative, in which the letter would
be expressed. It would run, ‘ Vide quid agas de Diodoro, quo progrediaris;
res clara est et invidiosa‚' &c.

49. Etiam tum, ‘ still? He is alluding here to the utter disregard of his
father’s advice which Verres showed afterwards in the case of Sthenius, which,
though mentioned earlier in the speech, happened later in point of time.
See above, 2. 3. 159 foll.

54. Absentem de reis eximit, ‘he suspends the trial durIng his
absence!
