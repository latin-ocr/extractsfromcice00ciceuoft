204 N ο T E S. sect. 1v.

81. Sine ulla divina ratione, ‘without taking any account of the
gods?

83. Quadam is not to be connected with the negative, in which case
‘ ulla’ would be required, but it qualifies ‘ratione.' The positive sentence
would run thus, ‘ et domus et respublica ratione quadarn et disciplina desig-
nata videtui-‚⁹ where ‘quadam’ implies that ‘ ratione’ is to-be taken with
some modification‚ and is not used in its full literal significance. Then
the negatives imply that the whole sentence would under certain circum-
stances be untrue.

88. At, as before, in the sense of ⁸ at enim.¹

94. Ita fit, inquit, ‘true‚ said he.’

96. Vect ores, ‘the passengets.’ An irregular use ofa verbal substantive
in ‘ -0r' with a passive signification.
