23. Continentia, ‘the integrity‚’ referring to Fabricius’ refusal of the

presents and offers of Pyrrhus.
24. Duo propugnacula belli Punici, ‘those two bulwarks of Rome

in the Punic war.' Cp. with the phrase, Virg. Aen. 6. 843,
‘ Duo fulmina belli
Scipiadas, cladem Libyae.’

Observe, however, that Virgil is here referring to the two other Scipios, the
elder and younger Africanus. Cnaeus and Publius Scipio were brothers:
Publius was Consul in 218 13.c., the year that Hannibal entered Italy. He
was sent to Spain to stop Hannibal's advance‚ but, being too late to stop
Hannibal's crossing the Rhone, he sent his own army on to Spain under his
brother’s command, and returned to Cisalpine Gaul to take the command of
the forces there. After the battle of the Trebia he went to Spain to resume
his proper command, and there he and his brother contended successfully
with Hasdrubal for six years, till iu 211 B.c. they were both defeated and
slain. But they had done their work, having prevented Hasdrubal from
sending reinforcements to Hannibal during the critical period of his cam-
paigns in Italy. Publius was father of Africanus Major.

27. Inter horum aetates interiectus, ‘who comes between them in
date?

32. Alicuius: governed by ‘similes' at the end of the sentence.

Horum, ⁶ the rnen of the present day.'

33. Qi signis, qui tabulis, ‘ in statues and paintings.'

34. Corinthiis operibus, ‘ works of art from Corinth? It was especially
famous for statues made of a peculiar kind of bronze called ‘Aes Corinthia-
cum.’ So Virgss, Georg. 2. 446, includes among the luxuries of the great
at Rome,

‘ Illusas auro vestes, Ephyreiaque aera‚’
Ephyra being an old name of Corinth.
16. 1. Consul iterum, ‘in his second Consulship.'
Ex insidiis, ‘ in an ambuscade! Ex means literally, ‘ by persons rising
out of an ambuscade.’ ,

2. Duce—imperatore. Observe the distinction of the two words.
Xanthippus was the real general who conducted the campaign, Hamilcar
the nominal commander in chief. Xanthippus was a Greek soldier of
fortune, who had corne to Africa to take service with the CarthaginianS.
He pointed out so clearly to the government the mistakes of their generals
to which their defeats had been owing, that they entrusted him with the
direction of their forces, though leaving the nominal command with their
own generals.

3. Iuratus, ‘under oath': the participle is used actively‚ as if it came
trorn a deponent verb. So ⁶ pransus ’ from ‘ prandeo‚' ‘ potus' a participle of
⁴ poto‚’ ‘ coenatus’ from ‘ eoeno,’ and others. The construction with ‘ ut' is
unusual with ‘ iu1’0‚' which, when referring to the future, usually takes the
sut. inf.
