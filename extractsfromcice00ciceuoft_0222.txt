202 N O TE S. Sect. IV.

11. Africanum. He means Scipio Africanus Minor, who was believed to
have been murdered in his bed by agents of the popular party, whom he
opposed, Β. c. 129. Cp. Scipio’s Dream, note on l. 50.

13. Meus. The speaker is C. Aurelius Cotta, a distinguished orator.
His mother was Rutilia.

14. Rutilius. This was P. Rutilius Rufus. He was a man of great
integrity and firmness‚ and when serving as Legatus in Asia, under QMucius
Scaevola, he incurred the hostility of the Publicani by the vigour with which
he repressed their extortions‚ and was in consequence impeached and con—
victed on a false charge of malversation, got up against him by those whose
robberies he had interfered with, and compelled to go into banishment. He
was famous as an orator.

15. Drusus. M. Livius Drusus who was assassinated 13.c. 91.

17. Scaevola. Q Mucius Scaevola, who perished in the Proscription
of Marius and Carbo, Β. c. 82.

20. Qibus bonis male evenerit, ‘ all the good men who have been

unfortunate!
25. At, ‘ but, it will be said.’ ‘ At’ here introduces a supposed objection

which the speaker answers. ‘ At enim' is more usual in this sense. See
note on Pt. 1. Sect. 1. 25, 44.

Melius fuit, ‘it would have been better.’ The English idiom with such
expressions as this is adapted to the fact that that which ought to or might
have happened, did not happen, and implies this by the use ofthe subjunctive
mood. The Latin idiom, more strictly accurate, expresses that the expediency
or possibility was real, although the event did not happen. This is the regular
Latin construction with such words and phrases as ⁸ oportet,’ ‘necesse est.¹
‘ par‚’ ‘fas,' ‘justum est‚’ ‘ debeo,’ ⁶ possum,’ ‘ licet.' See Zumpt, Lat. Gr.
ᾗ 518.

27. Varius. Q. Varius Hybrida, a native of Sucro in Spain, who was
tribune of the plebs in Β, c. 90. He was put to death in the following year
under a law which he himself had carried for punishing all who had aided
the Socii in taking up arms against Rome. Nothing more is known of his
having been the murderer of Drusus and Metellus beyond Cicero's assertion
here.

28. Si, supply ‘ periit! The argument is, ‘ Ifyou mean to say that Varius'
punishment is a proof of the interference of the gods, then Ι reply that they
had better have prevented the crime than punished it.'

32. In ipso Graeciae flore. Two different meanings are assigned to
this expression, 1. ‘ when Greece was just at its prime‚’ 2. ‘in the choicest
city of Greece: i. e. at Athens. The latter seems to give most tone to the
sentence.

33. At, same as above, ‘but‚ you will say.' ν

Apollodorus. The sentence does not run very regularly. If he repeats
the name of Phalaris in the supposed objecti0n‚ it would have been consistent
to have repeated that of Pisistratus also, instead of substituting a fresh in·
