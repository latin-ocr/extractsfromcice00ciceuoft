sect. 111. sczmo's DREA M. 1 59

113. Subter is here an adverb. Regionem is governed by obtinet.

114. Tempanio, ‘the controlling principle.’

118. Infra iam nihil est, ‘below this there is nothing.’ The force
of iarn is, ‘ when you come below this, henceforth you find nothing.’

121. Media. Observe that the earth is'regarded as the centre of the
system, and as alone fixed, all the rest moving round it. It is interesting
to compare these ancient notions of the universe with the more accurate
knowledge of modern times.

122. Nutu suo, ‘by their own gravity.' Cp. De Or. 3. 45 'tetra sua
vi nutuque tenetur!

123. Ut me recepi, ‘when 1 recovered myself.'

125. Tam dulcis sonus. The idea which is here expressed of the
⁸ music of the spheres ’ was a favourite one with the ancient philosophers.
That the harmonicus order of the universe should produce a harmony of
sound seemed to them natural, from the high place which they gave to
musical harmony in their systems. The language of Milton’s Hymn on the
Nativity‚ st. 13, will illustrate several of the expressions which Cicero here
uses:

Δ · Ring out, ye crystal spheres,
Once bless our human ears,
If ye have power to touch our senses so,
And let your silver chime
Move in melodious time,
And let the base of heaven’s deep organ blow,
And with your ninefold harmony
Make up full consort to the angelic symphony.'

Hic est—efficit. The musical terms here are somewhat difficult to
render. ‘ This is,’ said he, ‘ the sound ¹which, made up of intervals unequal,
but yet proportionally divided by [divine] reason, is produced by the swing
and movement of the spheres themselves, and, blending treble with base,
produces uniformly varied harmonies! ‘Ratione ' means ‘ the mind of the

summus deus” 'mentioned above.

128. Acuta cum gravibus: cp. Hor. A. P. 349

‘Poscentique gravem persaepe remittit acutum?

129. Tanti motus incitari, ⁶ such mighty movements be set
going.'

131. Quam ab causam—infimus, ‘hence it comes to pass that the
heavenly sphere whetein the stars are set, being the highest, as its revolution
is more rapid‚ moves with a treble and lively sound ; our lunar sphere, which
is lowest, with the deepest bass.'

134. Nam gives the reason why the lunai· sphere, and not the earth, is
reckoned as the lowest.

136. In quibus—duorum, ‘two of which have the same note.' Vis
here means ‘ musical power.' He does not say which two out of the eight
he means.
