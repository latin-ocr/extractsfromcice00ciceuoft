246. Sic se adhibere, ‘to condu‘ct himself in such a manner.' This
last sentence shows what Cicero’s meaning is in the whole passage. He
means to recommend ⁴ lenitas ' as an accompaniment to the ‘ severitas,’ which
he has already urged, and he does so here on the ground that it would be even
more acceptable in the provinces, where the governor was an autocrat, and
there was no one else to appeal to, than it was at Rome, where there were
many resources for protection.

249. Cyrus ille, &a This is a true description of Xenophon’s Cyro—

The sentence as resumed after the parenthesis does not fit on to the part

256. Quibus—redderent, ‘whose power was given them on the con-
dition of their surrendering it again.’

258. Huc omnia—aliis, ⁶ that those who rule others should make
this the airn of all they do?

260. Antiquissimum, ¹ your chief object ;’ ‘ antiquus,' as derived from
‘ ante‚’ may naturally be referred to what is ‘before’ in point of regard as

superlative.

266. Nullum-civitatibus, ‘no cities are involved in fresh deth.'

one of the twelve cities which formed the original Ionian confederation-
Cp. Hdt. 1. 142. Chios was also included in it.

old verb ‘calvor,’ ‘to cheat,' which occurs in a fragment of the Twelve
Tables. The substantive is used in the sense of a ‘ quibble ’ in Pt. 1. Sect.
11. 2 3. 1.

281. Nullius inopiam ac solitudinem—exclusam tuo. The abstract
substantives here must be turned in English into a ‘concrete form: ⁸ no one,
however poor and unbefriended, is ever excluded, I do not merely say from the
ordinary means of approach to you when you are in public and on the
bench, but even from your private house and bed-chamber.’
