-13. GREEK ANEC'DOTES. 35

7. 5. Eumdem esse, ‘thatI equally exist.’

6. Creditote. Observe the future force. The longer form of the impera-
tive has always some distinct reference to future time, and it is on this account
that it is used in laws, wills‚ and other like documents‚ not because it con-
veys a stronger command. It is used in this passage because Cyrus is refer-
ring to the time after his death.

Etiam si nullum videbitis, ‘even though you do not see me at all!

20. Remissi, ‘released‚' i. e. as explained by what follows, ‘ corporis
vinculis?

24. Hanc omnem pulchritudinem, ‘all the beauties we see around
us‚‘ ‘ this beautiful world of ours.'

8. 1. Philippo minitanti, an anacoluthon. Cicero puts this in the dat.
as if he were going to use ⁴ responderunt '; then, as their reply was in the
form os a question, he substitutes ‘ quaesiverunt‚’ which is equivalent to ⁶ re-
sponderunt quaerendo.’

9. 1. Omni generi satisfaciamus, ‘do our duty to all classes.'

10. 2. Posset, in subj. meod, because it states the reason which Themi—
stocles gave, and so is virtually oratio obliqua.

11. 1. Seriphio, ‘ a native of seriphus?

4. Nobilis ; i. e. ‘ umquam fuissem.’

12. 1. Satis, ‘thoroughly.’

4. Incontinenter, ‘ intemperate?

11. Palam, a substantive. ‘ Pala ’ is the part of a ring in which the stone
is set, the ⁶ hezel:

12. Converterat. Observe ‘ quum ’ with plup. ind. here, and with
inverterat below, expressing an action frequently repeated. Translate
quum, ‘ as often as.’

13. In locum, ‘into its proper place.’ ‘ Locus ’ is similarly used in Hor.
Od. 4. 12, 28 ⁴ Dulce est desipere in loco.‘

18. Si habeat—putet. Observe the difference of the two conditional
clauses. The first, with present subjunctives, is a mere supposition‚ ⁵ Even if
a wise man had this ring, he would not think‚’ &c.; in the second the im-
perfect subjunctive is used, because if the first supposition were a fact, the
second would be an impossible one.

19. Honesta enim—quaeruntur, ‘ for the good man seeks to do what
is right, not to hide what he does)

13. The story here told of Aratus will be best understood from the account
given of it in Thirlwall‚ Hist. of Greece, ch. 61.

4. Qum improviso oppressisset, ‘having surprised and over-
powered.’

9. Quinquaginta annorum possessiones moveri, ‘that fifty years’
occupatiori should be disturbed! ‘ Possessio ¹ in Roman law is ‘the actual
enjoyment of property,’ without implying ownership. ⁸ Possessionibus '
above must be translated ‘estates,' though it implies that the strict right
of ownership did not belong to them.
