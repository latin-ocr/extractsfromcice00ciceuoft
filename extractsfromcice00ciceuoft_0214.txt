231. Genuini‚ ‘ the jaw-teeth,’ ⁸ grinders‚‘ from ⁸ genae,’ ¹ the jaws.’

233. Excipi t, ‘ succeeds,· ¹ comes next to.’

Stomachus, here means ‘the gullet‚’ or ‘aesophagus.' It is a Greek
word connected with στόμα, and it was only in later medical writers that
it was applied to what we call ‘ the stomach.’ Strictly speaking the pharynx
comes immediately behind a—nd below the tongue, then the aesophagm,
⁴ stomachus ' therefore here must include both.

237. Ipsius partes eae, &c. The pharynx and aesophagus are tubes,
composed of muscular rings, which spontaneously contract as the food passes
downwards, so as to force it on towards the stomach, and prevent
regurgitation.

²39· Aspera arteria, ‘ the wind-pipe‚' ἡ τραχεῖα ἀρτηρίας from the
Greek adjective comes the other medical name, the ‘ trachea!

240. Paullo supra quam—annectitur, ‘ a little above where the
tongue joins the gullet!

244. Operculo. The epiglottis. a sort of moveable valve, which protects
the as erture by which the trachea· communicates with the pharynx.

246. Alvi. ‘ Alvus ’ is properly ‘the abdomen: ² here it is used for the
principal contents of the abdomen, viz, the intestine.

249. Nervis, not ⁴ nerves‚' but ‘ fibrous tissue.’

Arcet, ‘shuts in;' its more usual sense is ‘to shut out‚' ‘exclude,' but
cp. Scipio's Dream, l. 109, where it is again joined in this sense with con-
tineo, ‘ orbis caelestis, arcens et continens ceteros.'

252. Ut facile—dividantur, the order is, ‘ut, exterendo cibo, et
(=both) calore, quem multum habet, et praeterea spiritu, omnia cocta atque
confecta facile dividantur in reliquum corpus.’

255. Raritas quaedam, ‘ a kind of looseness of texture? Cp. Plin. 8.
43, 68, quoted in Smith’s Dict. ‘ (asini) nec pontes transeunt, per raritatem
eorum translucentibus fluviis.’

258. Cibus animalis, ‘the air which is their nourishment.' ‘Cibus
animalis’ might be construed ‘oxygen,’ though this ingredient of the at-
rnosphere‚ necessary for the life of all animated beings, was only discovered
by Priestley in ΑΛ). 1774, and therefore must have been unknown, as distinct
from the air generally, by Cicero.

261. Portas iecoris, ‘ the orifice of the liver.⁸

262. Pertinent ad iecur, ‘lead to the liver.'

263. Inde pertinentes, ‘leading from it‚' i. e. from the liver.

272. Illa, ‘another‚’ literally, ‘that other one.' Nam is used here, to
introduce the fulfilment of the promise implied in ‘explicetur,’ as ’γάρ is so
often in Greek after a future tense, or anything equivalent to one. It is best
omitted in translating.

275. Resphando, ‘ by the act of respiration.'

concipitur, ‘is received.’ Cicero's anatomy and physiology are at
fault here. He is wrong in giving to the heart anything to do with respiration.
It is the centre of the circulatory system.
