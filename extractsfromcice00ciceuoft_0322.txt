302 N O T E S. Sect. V.

8. How Verres robbed Segesta osan Image os Diana.

11. 8.. 1. Segesta. The legends about the foundation of Segesta vary
considerably. Thucydides. 6. 2, speaks of it as founded by Trojan settlers,
fugitives from the destruction of their city by the Greeks. According to
another version, it was founded by Egestus or Acestes, who was the son of a
Trojan mother and the river-god Crimisus. Virg. Ae. 5. 38

‘Troia Crimiso conceptum flumine mater
Quem genuit.’
The story of the Trojan origin of Segesta was convenient to the Romans
when at war with the Carthaginians in Sicily, and they naturally made the
most of it.

7. A Karthaginiensibus vi captum. The destruction of Segesta by
the Carthaginians is nowhere recorded in history. 1t may be an exaggerated
account of its conquest by Agathocles.

24. De quibus antea dixi. See above, 2. 3. 29 foll.

27. Quo =in quem.

28. Supplicii causa, ‘by way of punishment.'

30. Utrum, ⁴ which of the two.'

31. Suis, ⁶ their own countrymen‚’ like Phalaris.

47. Quasi illa ipse face percussus esset. Cicero means,‘as though
he were a lunatic‚’ struck by Diana's torch, Le. by the rays of the moon.

49. Demoliantur‚ ‘ take it down trorn its pedestal.’

53. Opponebant, ‘quoted to him‚’ ⁸ met him with?

60. Nautis exigendis, ‘in pressing men for the navy.'

61. Frumento imperando, in fixing the amount of corn they had to
pay as ‘ decima' or tithe. ‘Imperare frumentum civitati’ is the usual phrase
tor this, like ‘imperare milites sociis‚' and as ‘imperare' in this sense takes
an accusative, it can have in this sense the gerundive construction.

63. Evocabat, ‘summoned from home?

71. Tollendum locatur, ‘is ordered to be taken down.' Literally,
‘the taking of it down is let by contract.’ ‘Locare’ is the opposite word
to ‘ redimere.’

77. Quod quum exportaretur. Zumpt’s reading is ‘exportabaturf
Either mood is admissible‚ and the sentence is a good instance of the differ-
ence between ‘quum’ with the indicative and ‘quum’ with the subjunctive
in a narrative. With the indicative quum=⁶whilst,’ and the two actions
are regarded as coincident; with the subjunctive quum=⁴when‚' and the
action of the principal verb is regarded as consequent on, and so caused by
that of the temporal sentence. Below, in 1. 89, the verb must be ‘expor-
taretur‚' because it is dependent on an infinitive mood.

89. Complesse, ‘loaded it.’

101. Tamen is correlative to ‘loco mutatos which=' quantum locum
mutaverat:
