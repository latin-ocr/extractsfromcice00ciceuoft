1. ROME’S RULE OF HER PROVINCES. 287

with the Carthaginians) been at war with the Romam, who supported his
cnemies, the Mamertines of Messana, made a separate peace with them, and
an allianoe, to which he adhered faithfully all his life.

8. Id quod ornamentum imperii est. He means that the possession
os provinces was one of the great distinctions os the Empire of Rome. A
‘Provincia' was a country beyond the bounds of Italy, which had been
conquered, and reduced to form a part of the dominion of Rome, under a
military governor. The word is probably derived from ‘providentia‚’ and
means a territory entrusted to the care of some one. See Dict. of Ant. ν. ‘ Pro-
vincia! Sicily, with the exception of Hiero’s kingdom, was made a province
at the end of the first Punic War‚ and when in the second Punic War
Hiero's successor Hieronymus had abandoned the alliance with Rome and
joined the Carthaginians, his kingdom also, after the taking of Syracuse by
Marcellus, was added to the rest, and the whole island became a province,

11. Qae venissent, subjunctive as being dependent on the subjunctive
⁸ deficerent.'

14. Itaque—factus est, ‘and accordingly our ancestors found this island
a stepping-stone to the conquest of Africa.’

15. Tam facile, ‘as easily as they did?
16. Illud, ⁴ it‚· i. e. Sicily. ‘ Pateret' being a copulative verb, the pronoun

which is its subject takes the gender of the predicate, and not of the word
to which it refers. This is the ordinary Latin construction with both
demonstrative and relative pronouns. Cp. Madvig, Lat. Gr. 313; Key,
Lat. Gr. 1039.

Rei frumentariae subsidium, ‘to surnish supplies of grain.' Cp. Cic.
de Leg. Manil. 12, 34, where Cicero speaks of Sicily, Africa, Sardinia, as
‘ tria frumentaria subsidia reipublicae.’

1·9. Monumentis, ‘memorials.’ Cp. Pt. 2. ch. 6. 15, where ‘monu-
mentum Marii’ means the temple built by Marius as a memorial of his
victories.

22. Marcellus. How far what is here said of> Marcellus is true may be
gathered from note on 13. 6 of this Part, p. 306.

24. Superatis hostibus temperavit, ‘dealt gently with his enemies
'when conquered :' with this use of the dative after ⁶ tempero‚’ cp. in Verr. 2.
6 ‘ si cuiquam ulla in re unquam temperaverit, ut vos quoque ei temperetis ;'
and Hor. Od. 3. 24, 18

‘Illic matre carentibus
Privignis mulier temperat innocens.'

25. Qum—esset. ‘ Qum' is used here with ‘tum’ in the following
clause in the same way as above. ‘Qum‚’ in this sense, does not usually
take a subjunctive. Key, Lat. Gr. 1231, says, ‘ quum' followed by ‘ tum‚' in
the sense of ‘ not only—but also‚' has generally the indicative, occasionally
the subjunctive; and he adds in a note, ⁴ the examples of the subjunctive
construction are not numerous, and what there are seem open to doubt?
