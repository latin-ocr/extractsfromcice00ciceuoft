important for them to attend to, as a foundation on which
higher matters of scholarship may be built afterwards.

The Editor is unwilling to allow the complete work to

appear without adding a few words of acknowledgment
and thanks. He has derived help from the notes of
Mr. Long on the passages from the Verrine Orafions, and on
Cicero's letter to Quintus, and also from the Oxford edition
of the Tusculan Disputations ; and sor several illustrations
of passages from the De Officiis he is indebted to the
elaborate edition of Dr. H. A. Holden. The translations of
sentences and passages were in all cases made previously

to any reference to other editions.

His special thanks are due to his friend, the Rev. Dr.
Mitchinson‚ Head Master of the King's School, Canterbury,
for valuable suggestions and contributions to the notes on
various points of Physiology and Natural History in the
⁴ Beauties of Nature?

It may, perhaps, be well to mention that the selection of
passages is entirely original, and not in any degree borrowed
from any other work.

and the errors which have been discovered corrected: the
punctuation has also, it is hoped, been improved.
