any scruple.'

Obiecto signo, ‘ though it was an omen sent to stop him! See above,

sacred fowls.' ⁸ Tripudium ' was when the fowls ate so greedily that the
grains fell from their mouths and struck the ground.

Disserebat, ‘put off‚' i. e. ‘ bade him put off!

49. Praeclara, ironical, like ⁸ fine ' in English, καλὸς in Greek.

51. Signa convelli. The standards were planted in the ground during
a halt : ‘plucking up the standards ’ was therefore the signal for marching. The
opposite word of command was ‘statuere signa‚’ ‘ to halt! Cp. Livy 5. 55
‘ Signifer, statue signum : hic manebimus optime.’

52. Primi hastati. Supply ‘ordinis.' ‘ The standard—bearer of the first

l‘oreille‚’ ‘he pinched my ear.¹ So in the next sentence, ‘quum in cunis
parvulo dormienti apes in labellis consedissent‚' ‘ when a swarm of bees settled

be caresully observed in writing Latin.

68. Amores ac deliciae tuae, ‘your darling friend.' Amores in
