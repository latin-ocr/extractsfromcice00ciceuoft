ΙΙ. 8, 9. ROME’S RULE OF HER PROVINCES. 303

102. Quo scelere suscepto, ‘having committed this crime‚’ litemlly,
⁴ having incurred, taken upon himself, this guilt.'

107. Quod quum, ⁸ but when ;' ‘ quod’ is here merely a conjunction. See
note below on ⁴ quod tamen,' 2. 13. 112.

9. How Verres treated Sopater at Tyndaris.

11. 9. 7. Apud eos—coleretur. The mood of ‘coleretur’ makes it
part of what the deputies had said, and therefore we should have expected
‘se' rather than ‘eos.’ Cicero uses the ‘eos’ as if he were inserting the
clause in which it occurs as his own remark.

18. Proagoro. This appears to have been the title of the chief magis-
trate.

21. Ne multa, i.e. ⁶dicam,’ ‘to be brief,’ ‘not to make a long story
of it.'

25. Attigisset is the oratio obliqua of ‘attigerit.’

Quam mihi—senatum? ⁴ Don’t talk to me of sacred character, or
penalties, or senate.’

33. Conventu. See above, note on 2. 2. 44.

40. Videres, ‘you might see,’ or rather in English, ‘you might have
se'en‚' i.e. ‘if you had been there.’ It is a conjunctive. being the apodosis
of the suppressed hypothetical sentence, not dependent on ⁶ quum,’ for in an
inverted sentence like this, where the verb which follows ‘ quum ’ is really the
principal verb, it is always put in the indicative, except when, as here, the
principal verb would of itself be conjunctive. , The real sentence is, ‘ Hoc vix
plane imperato, illum videres.’ On these inverted sentences, which are very
common, especially at the beginning of a fresh stage in a narrative, see
Zumpt, 580. 12.

42. Caederet. Conjunctive of deliberation. The whole passage is, of
course, ironical.

50. Deligari, ‘tied down.' It is the regular wor’d for fastening a man
up for scourging.

52. Aere. This may be either from ‘ aer‚’ in which case it means ‘in the
open air;' or from ‘aes,' in which case it means ⁶ on metal.’ The former
seems the best.

61. D isposite, ⁶ arranging his offences under different heads!

65. Est. With each ‘ est' supply ‘ crimen!

Est pecuniarum captarum, ‘it comes under the head of extortion: the
usual title for which was ‘ repetundae.'

66. Pecuniae magnae. This is a genitive of quality attached to
¹ signum,’ ‘ a statue of, i.e. worth, a large sum.’

Peculatus, ‘embezzlement of state property! Under these two heads
he represents it as an offence both against the allies, to whom the statue
belonged, and against the respublica who had restored it to them.
