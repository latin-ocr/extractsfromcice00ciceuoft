Catonis: sc. Cato the Elder.

14. Missum factum, ‘ discharged.’

Bello Persico; not ‘ Persian war,' but ‘the war with Perses,’ the last
king of Macedonia.

Qod, qui—mitigatam. Observe that ⁴ quod’ here is dependent
on ‘ mitigatam,’ and not on ‘ animadverto: the English order of the words
being this: ‘ animadverto tristitiam rei mitigatam [esse] lenitate verbi, quod
is, qui proprio nomine “ perduellis '’ esset, “ hostis ’' vocaretur.’ The ‘ quod’
introduces the instance in which the ‘ mitigatio ' is observed.

19. Lenitate verbi, ‘ by a sostened expression!

22. Status dies cum hoste. This and the following are fragments

from the old laws of the twelve tables made by the Decemviri. Status
dies means ‘ a day fixed for the trial of an action.'

23. Adversus hostem, ‘ as against a foreigner the right of ownership is
good for ever‚' i.e. ownership could not be acquired by a foreigner by ‘ pos-
scssio,' or prescription‚ that is, by any length of occupatiori.

Hostem. Cicero says that the application of ¹ hostis ' (stranger) to mean
‘ enemy,’ was a sostening of the asperity of war: the truth rather is that it
proves that the Romans looked upon all strangers as enemies. lt is observed
(Donaldson‚ Varr. p. 206) that ‘ the Latin “ hostis” and Greek ξένος, starting
from opposite points have interchanged their significations.’ ‘ Hostis’ ori-
ginally means, ⁶ a person entertained by another,' being connected with
‘ hospes,’ ‘ hostia,’ &c., but carne gradually to mean first ‘a stranger‚’ ‘a
foreigner‚’ then ⁸ an enemy,’ whereas ξένος, originally denoting a ‘ stranger‚’
being derived from ἐκ (ἐξένος), came in the end to signisy ⁶ an entertainer'
and ‘ a friend.¹

26. A peregrino—remansit, ⁶ it has ceased to be applied to foreigners,
and has remained as the proper title of one who bears arms against
another.’

27. Proprie means that it is now regarded as its original meaning and
not as a derived or figurative one.
